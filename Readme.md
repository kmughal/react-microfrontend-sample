# Introduction

This is a sample code for Microfront using react.

You can adopt this approach with any library. Feel free to tweak it.

## How to start?

It uses yarn workspaces so you have to setup yarn and turn on that. To start this simply type 
``` yarn start ```

This will start shell , site 1 and site 2. Shell is the one which will load assets from Site 1 and Site 2 using the MicroFrontend component. 

Feel free to reach out to me if you have any question or better idea. Though I have seen / build something docker and SSC as well.
